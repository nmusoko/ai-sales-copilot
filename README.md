# 🤖 AI Sales Copilot  
### *LangChain · Whisper · Streamlit · Python*

---

## 📌 Overview
Sales representatives in small and medium businesses (SMBs) spend **10–20 minutes** after every client call summarizing discussions, drafting follow-up emails, and updating CRMs manually.  
**AI Sales Copilot** automates this process using generative AI — it listens, understands, and writes like a real sales assistant.

## 🎯 Problem → Solution → Impact

**Problem**  
Post-call administrative tasks are repetitive, time-consuming, and error-prone.  
Sales reps lose focus and valuable time that could be spent closing deals.

**Solution**  
AI Sales Copilot automatically:
1. Transcribes sales calls (via Whisper)
2. Summarizes discussions and detects sentiment
3. Generates a professional follow-up email in the rep’s tone
4. Logs key action items and next steps in a structured CRM format

**Impact**  
- Saves ~10 minutes per call  
- Ensures consistent, high-quality communication  
- Keeps CRM data accurate and up-to-date
